  "description": "When investigating the clouds, V is given the option of two dolls, Skye and Angel, each programmed to serve V's exact needs. When V sees Skye in her private room, Skye instead gives the mercenary therapy, comforting them. Skye is calm and empathetic, listening to every word and providing advice. When all dialogue is exhausted, V gives Skye the saveword, breaking her programming. Immediately the doll is confused, becoming mad for being used to get close to Evelyn. After more prodding, Skye divulges where Evelyn's booth is and forces V out, threatening to call security.",
