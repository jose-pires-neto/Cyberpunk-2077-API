  "description": "Ringo is among the bartenders at theForlorn Hope, taking over whenMarianneis indisposed. Ringo's a showman, always making noise and drawing attention to himself. He effects an Old-West style, complete with ten-gallon hat and twin six-guns. Rumor around the bar has it that he's pretty fast with the irons. Back in the old-days, he was LRT-601 's squad automatic weapons man. Ringo is a good gunsmith, and he often abandons the bar to put in time in the weapons shop with Gunsights.",
