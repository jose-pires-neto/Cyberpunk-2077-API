  "description": "Stanley is the radio host ofNight City's early morningnewsflash. He has a daughter. At some point, he took his daughter to abodysculptingclinic and requested them to perform whatever operations she wanted to undergo, even if it was aExoticfull body conversion. The clinic staff had initially refused this request, as exotics had fallen out of fashion three decades ago, but relented in the end and provided a discount on the operations. Shortly afterwards, Stanley disowned his daughter as he wished for her to \"look like human royalty\" if she was to receive his inheritance.",
